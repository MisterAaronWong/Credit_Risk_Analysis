# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes for credit risk analysis. This is because credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. First, the data was oversampled using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and then undersampled using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Afterwards, a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm was implemented.
