# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes for credit risk analysis. This is because credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. First, the data was oversampled using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and then undersampled using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Afterwards, a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm was implemented. Next, the usuge of the BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier machine learning models that reduce bias are compared to predict credit risk. Finally, the performance of these models were evaluated and a recommendation was made on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.
